1. put the CSS into this Anki folder:
   - **Windows**:  C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Roaming\Anki2\yourankiaccountname\collection.media\
   - **Linux**:  ~\.local\share\Anki2\collection.media\
2. When naming the file, append _ symbol at the beginning, otherwise Anki will delete the file when checking the media (for example "\_styling.css")
